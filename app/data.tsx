      `Since January 2021, I have been working as a Software Engineer at Salesforce.
          During this time, I have contributed to three different full-stack teams within the Automation Platform
          organization, which focuses on Flows and Orchestrations to help customers automate their business processes. I
          have delivered features and enhancements across both backend and frontend using technologies and frameworks
          such as Java Spring, Lightning Web Components(LWC), SQL, and design patterns like Event - Driven Architecture,
          Pub / Sub, Factory, and Visitor, as well as implementing robust transaction management to ensure data integrity
          and consistency.`,
      `Some of the projects I am most proud of include the integration of MuleSoft services into Flows, enabling
          debugger views for errored orchestrations, and developing the element search UI in the Flow Builder canvas. I
          am also a regular participant in company hackathons and have been a three-time winner in organization-wide
          hackathons.`,
      `My journey at Salesforce, particularly my experience on three different teams, has transformed me into a
          well-rounded and mature software engineer. I have developed the ability to collaborate effectively across
          diverse team settings and cultures, learn rapidly, and quickly get up to speed to deliver high-quality
          contributions. Moreover, I have proven myself as a strong engineer capable of understanding and working with
          very complex codebases.`,

      `Driven by a passion for leveraging technology to make a strong social impact, I co-founded and led a team of
          over seven software engineers to develop BridgeBurma — a professional networking and mentorship platform that
          connects Burmese students worldwide. Since its inception in 2019, the platform has attracted thousands of
          users globally. I remained actively involved until January 2023, when I decided to pursue other interests. We
          initially developed and managed the full-stack application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js,
          and Node.js), later migrating it to Next.js and hosting it on Google Cloud Run.
          In my role, I implemented features such as authentication, email handling, forum posting and searching,
          commenting, post-sorting, user profiles, mentor profile listing and searching, among many others. Through this
          project, I gained extensive practical skills in managing a scalable web application—including hosting and cost
          management—and working with cloud technologies and services such as Google Compute Engine, Google Cloud Run,
          AWS S3, SendGrid Email, and implementing inverted indexes for search using Elasticsearch. This experience not
          only enhanced my technical expertise but also taught me to take initiative in delivering features based on
          customer feedback, honed my leadership and mentoring skills, and improved my ability to navigate ambiguous
          work settings to solve complex problems.`,

      `During the summer of 2020, I interned on the Sales Cloud Einstein team at
          Salesforce, which develops AI solutions to optimize customers' sales pipelines. My primary project was to
          create a dashboard that visualizes sales opportunity data and provides intuitive insights into the internal
          workings of the Opportunity Scoring machine learning model. By successfully integrating this dashboard into
          the Core app, I ensured its inclusion in the next pilot product release. This role involved extensive work
          with the Salesforce core stack in Java, where I developed new message handlers and implemented security
          enforcement permissions. Additionally, I leveraged the Salesforce query language and Einstein Analytics UI to
          create data flows and charts.`,
